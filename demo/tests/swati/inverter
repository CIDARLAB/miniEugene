N = 4.

// an inverter consists of transcriptional units
Inverter CONTAINS TU.

// transcriptional units must appear exactly 4 times
TU EXACTLY 4.

// a transcription unit contains of
// a promoter, an RBS, a CDS, and a terminator
TU CONTAINS Promoter.
TU CONTAINS RBS.
TU CONTAINS CDS.
TU CONTAINS Terminator.


// the order must be as follows:
// Promoter, RBS, CDS, Terminator
Promoter BEFORE RBS.
RBS BEFORE CDS.
CDS BEFORE Terminator.
